# portfolio

This repo contains a minimal, responsive static portfolio scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS).

Get started:

1. Open the repo in a browser preview or run a local static server:

```bash
cd /Users/ankitsaxena/Documents/Github/github-portfolio
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

2. Edit `index.html` to replace `Your Name`, bio, projects, and contact details.
3. Styles are in `css/styles.css` and site behavior is in `js/main.js`.

Deployment suggestions:
- Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.
- Or deploy to Netlify/Vercel by connecting the repo.

If you want, I can:
- Replace the placeholder content with your real projects and bio.
- Add a resume, images, and a contact form with serverless backend.
